# Initial Git Etiquette

1) Work in a branch for yourself, possibly even making your own directory. Within terminal of your choice:
  `git checkout -b ${branch_name}`
  
   - Make changes etc and save
   
   `git status` shows the different changes done.
   
   `git add .` adds all files changed. `git add ${file_name.py}` adds that specific file.
   
   `git commit -m "I made changes. I can say whatever here, whether vague or descriptive"` commits the changes to be pushed up to the repo.
   
   `git push`
   
  
2) This is when the other person merges the changes within the Github GUI. Probably easiest.

3) Now both people pull down those most recent changes.

  `git pull` or `git pull origin main`
