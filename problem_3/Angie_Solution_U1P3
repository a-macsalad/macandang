#Problem 3

"""
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters 
occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your 
program should print: 
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', 
then your program should print:
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
"""

s = 'zcbobobegghakl'
r = ''
c = ''
for char in s:
    if (c == ''):
        c = char
    elif (c[-1] <= char):
        c += char
    elif (c[-1] > char):
